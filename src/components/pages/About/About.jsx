        <p>
          Hi, I'm <strong>Antonella Portugal</strong>, a developer with a strong
          background in data science. While my expertise lies in analyzing and
          interpreting data, Iâ€™ve always been curious about web development.
          This project is my way of exploring that curiosityâ€” learning how to
          build interactive applications while combining structured data with
          user-friendly interfaces.
        </p>

        <h2>About This Project</h2>
        <p>
          This project is a <strong>recipe exploration web app</strong> that
          allows users to discover meals from around the world. The goal is to
          provide an easy-to-use interface where users can search for recipes,
          view detailed ingredients, and explore different cuisines. The app
          follows modern web development best practices, ensuring responsiveness
          and a smooth user experience. This project was made as a submission to
          my final project for TripleTenÂ´s Web Development bootcamp.
        </p>

        <h2>API Integration</h2>
        <p>
          The application fetches data from <strong>TheMealDB API</strong>, a
          free and open-source database for meal recipes. Through this API,
          users can:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>ðŸ”Ž Search for recipes by name</li>
          <li>ðŸ“‚ Filter meals by category</li>
          <li>ðŸ“– View recipe instructions and ingredient lists</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This integration allows for dynamic and real-time access to an
          extensive collection of recipes, making it a valuable tool for food
          enthusiasts.
        </p>
